How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    There are plus and minus where I can find the differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Sure, it saves much time to find differences.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Often times I forgot to save files, and therefore I prefer Google docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I can’t figure out yet.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You tell me.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It’s self-evident.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
